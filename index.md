# About this workshop

This is an intermediate workshop that will explore using the R statistics program for geospatial analysis.
In the first lesson we will run through some general GIS operations in R.
In the second lesson we will drive into geospatial analysis. We will preform geospatial pre-processing, get some explanatory statistics, and finally we build a simple species distribution model.
