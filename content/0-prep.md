R in amazing for processing and analysing spatial data. But its not ideal for visually exploring spatial data, or for creating vector datasets (i.e. lines and polygons shapefiles). I would recommend that you use <a href='https://www.qgis.org' target="_blank">QGIS</a> to visualise your data and to create and manipulate shapefile layers.

Lets open QGIS and have a look at the datasets we will be analysing in R
