R in amazing for processing and analysing spatial data. But its not ideal for visually exploring spatial data, or for creating vector datasets (i.e. lines and polygons shapefiles). I would recommend that you use <a href='https://www.qgis.org' target="_blank">QGIS</a> to visualise your data and to create and manipulate shapefile layers.

Lets open QGIS and have a look at the datasets we will be analysing in R. The data for this workshop is can be downloaded <a href='https://downgit.github.io/#/home?url=https://github.com/gu-eresearch/RgeospatialWorkshop/blob/main/data/data.zip' target='_blank'> here</a>
